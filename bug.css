The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, using `calc()` with percentages can sometimes lead to unexpected results, especially when dealing with nested elements or complex layouts.  The calculation might not be performed as intended, resulting in elements being positioned or sized incorrectly. For instance, if you try to calculate a width as `width: calc(50% - 10px);`, the `10px` subtraction might not be applied correctly if the parent element's width is dynamic or undefined.
