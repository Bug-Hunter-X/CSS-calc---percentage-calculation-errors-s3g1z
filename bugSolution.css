To avoid issues with `calc()` and percentages, consider using a more robust approach. For instance, use a JavaScript solution to calculate the values precisely before applying them to the CSS. Alternatively, carefully plan and test your `calc()` expressions, ensuring all values are correctly interpreted and applied. Or consider using alternative layout methods that don't rely on dynamic percentage calculations inside `calc()`:

```css
/* Instead of relying solely on calc for dynamic sizing, consider using Flexbox or Grid */
div {
  display: flex;
  width: 50%;
  /* ... rest of the styles ... */
}
```
If the calculation must be done in CSS, ensure that all parent elements have defined widths, or that your calculations account for potential `auto` values.  Thorough testing and debugging are essential.
